Work in progress.

## Installation

```
pip install -U pynwb
```

Some code requires HDMF 3.4.8 which has not yet been released.

## Usage

1. Modify the paths in `append_suite2p.py`.
2. Run `python append_suite2p.py`.

## TODO

- See comments marked "TODO" in the Python files
- Gzip all the big datasets
- Verify the converted data matches the original data
- Test on other data files
- Make code accept paths as command line arguments
- Add the older comparison?
